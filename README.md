Analyzing and Forecasting Product Demand for Strategic Inventory Management

This research focuses on improving inventory management through precise demand forecasting and anomaly identification. 
Using a quadratic exponential smoothing approach, we forecast monthly sales and examine historical product demand data from 2014 to 2019. 
Effective demand forecasting is the foundation of inventory management, affecting production planning, inventory levels, and overall business operations. 
We handle missing and inaccurate data, rectify negative demand numbers, and aggregate order demand to assure data integrity. 
Key visualizations show the main product categories and demand trends, while forecasting models exhibit the capacity to accurately estimate future demand. 
Seasonal decomposition divides demand patterns into observable, trend, seasonal, and residual components, while anomaly detection detects odd departures. 
This complete method offers firms significant insights into optimizing inventory management, lowering expenses, and improving strategic planning.
